# Analog-_Clock

Project Overview

The **Analog Clock** is a stunning interactive clock, created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Rather than building the clock structure, an empty clock image was used as a base on which the clock's hour, minute, and second hands were dynamically added and animated to represent the correct time.

Features

Real-time Updates: The clock hands move according to the real time.

- **Smooth Animations**: CSS makes the second, minute and hour hands move smoothly.

- **Efficient Design**: Using a readily available clock image saved much of the development time.

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To include the image of the clock.

- **CSS**: For the animation and styling of the clock's hands.

- **JavaScript**: For the dynamic features to update the clock live.

## How It Works

1. Clock Image This is the photograph of the clock for use as the background for the clock face.

2. CSS Styling: All design and layout for the clock hands are added here.

3. JavaScript Logic:

    - Gets the current time by using the Date object.

    - Calculates the rotation angle for each hand based on the time.

    - Dynamically updates the rotation by using CSS transformations.
